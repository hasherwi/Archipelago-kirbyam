\# Kirby \& The Amazing Mirror


\## Where is the options page?


You can read through all the options and generate a YAML here.



\## What does randomization do to this game?



This randomizer handles shard randomization for when bosses get defeated. Additional randomization will be added in future updates.



\## What items and locations get randomized?



Shards will be randomized between different bosses. Ex: If you defeat Gobbler you may receive the shard you'd normally get from defeating Dark Meta Knight.



\## What other changes are made to the game?



Additional changes planned, none currently implemented.



\## What does another world's item look like in Kirby \& The Amazing Mirror?



When you find an item that is not your own, you will be able to see what it was and who it was sent to the client window.



\## When the player receives an item, what happens?



You will not see an indicator in the game, instead you'll see you received an item from the client window.



\# Can I play offline?



Yes, the client and connector are only necessary for sending and receiving items. If you're playing a solo game, you
don't need to play online unless you want the rest of Archipelago's functionality (like hints). If
you're playing a multiworld game, the client will sync your game with the server the next time you connect.
