"""ROM patch support for Kirby & The Amazing Mirror.

At this stage, patching is kept minimal: we only produce a valid AP procedure
patch file so the world can generate. Full ROM integration (writing the auth
token, location tables, incoming item queue, etc.) should be added once
addresses.json contains the required ROM symbols and the injected base patch is
Kirby-specific.
